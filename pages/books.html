            <strong>Notes from the Tilt-a-Whirl</strong>
            <p>Author: Nathan D. Wilson</p>
            <p>
                Description: In these sparkling chapters, Wilson gives an 
                aesthetic examination of the ways in which humanity has 
                tried to make sense of this overwhelming carnival ride 
                of a world. He takes a whimsical, thought-provoking look
                at everything from the “magic” of quantum physics, to 
                nature’s absurdities, to the problem of evil, evolution
                and hell.
